# Component Name

Documentation and examples for the ComponentName component, used for ...

## Overview

A brief description of the component and its purpose. *Example:* The `ComponentName` component is a versatile UI element used for **[component's purpose]**. It provides **[key features]** and is typically used in **[context of use]**.

Introduce the component and its primary use cases. Mention when to use this component and what problems it solves. Highlight main features or unique aspects of the component in a concise way. For example, note if it supports multiple themes, sizes, or variations out-of-the-box.

The Component Name component in Inkline is versatile and can be easily customized to fit various use cases:

- *Typical usage:* Outline common scenarios (e.g., forms, navigation, data display) where this component is useful.
  Describe common real-world scenarios for this component to help developers understand its versatility:
- *Standalone usage:* Using `ComponentName` by itself to accomplish a basic UI task. *For example,* a `<Button>` component used on its own to trigger an action, or a `<Card>` component to display a piece of information in isolation.
- *In combination with other components:* Using `ComponentName` alongside other components. *For instance,* using a `<Dropdown>` component inside a toolbar, or placing a `<FormInput>` inside a form group component for structured forms. Explain how they work together and if any additional setup is needed.
- *Conditional or dynamic display:* Utilizing `ComponentName` to show or hide content based on user interaction or state. *E.g.,* using a `<Modal>` component to confirm user actions (appearing on a button click and closing on confirm/cancel events).
- *Form integration (if applicable):* If `ComponentName` is an input or relates to forms, outline using it within `<form>` elements or with form validation. *Example:* a custom select component used with Vuelidate or Inkline’s form validation, including how to bind it to form state.
- These use cases help illustrate how the component can be used in practice. For each use case, you might refer back to one of the examples in the **Usage** section or provide a brief code sample (optional) to demonstrate the pattern.

## Import

```ts
import { ComponentName } from 'inkline';
```

*Ensure that the Inkline styles are included in your project as per the Inkline [installation guide](/docs/getting-started) (so the component is styled correctly).*

## Usage

Provide examples of how to use the component in practice. Include code snippets and explanations for each example:

### Basic Usage

A basic example of `ComponentName` in its simplest form:

```vue
<template>
  <ComponentName prop1="..." />
</template>

<script setup>
// No additional setup required for basic usage
</script>
```

*Describe what this example does. For instance, explain default behavior or default prop values at play. This example shows `ComponentName` with minimal configuration, using the default settings for all unspecified props.*

### Example: [Common Variation]

Demonstrate a common variation or use case, such as using props or slots to customize the component:

```vue
<template>
  <ComponentName prop1="..." prop2="...">
    <!-- slot usage if any -->
    <span>Slot Content</span>
  </ComponentName>
</template>

<script setup>
// import or setup any needed state for the example
</script>
```

*Describe the variation. For example, this might show the component in a different state (active/disabled) or with a slot providing custom content. Highlight how the props or slots are used to achieve this variation.*

### Example: [Another Use Case] (optional)

If relevant, add more examples for other use cases (e.g., an advanced configuration, dynamic behavior, integration with forms or router). Each example should be followed by a short explanation.

*You can include as many examples as needed. Each should be focused on a specific use case or feature to keep it clear.*

## Props

## Events

## Slots

## Exposed Methods

-- Auto-generated --

To use these methods, ensure you have a `ref` on the component, then call them, for example: `myComponentRef.value.methodName()`. In **TypeScript**, you can import the component’s types or use `ComponentPublicInstance<InstanceType<typeof ComponentName>>` to get proper typing for the ref.

## Accessibility

Outline how the component supports accessibility (a11y) and what developers should do to ensure it remains accessible:

- **ARIA roles/attributes:** Mention any relevant ARIA roles or attributes the component uses. For example, if `ComponentName` is a custom button or link, it might add `role="button"` when rendered as an anchor for proper screen reader support ([Button | Components | BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/button#:~:text=When%20the%20,a%3E%60%20element)). If it’s a dialog, it should use `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`, etc. Document what is handled by the component and what needs to be provided (like `aria-label` for icons, etc.).
- **Keyboard navigation:** Explain how users can interact with the component via keyboard. E.g., “Users can press **Tab** to focus the ComponentName. Once focused, use **Space** or **Enter** to activate it (just like a native button).” If arrow keys or escape keys have special behavior, list them. Ensure to mention any key listeners the component implements for accessibility.
- **Focus management:** If the component automatically manages focus (for example, a modal might move focus inside it when opened), describe that. Advise on using focus traps or returning focus to the triggering element on close if relevant.
- **Additional guidelines:** Encourage providing alt text or labels. For instance, if the component has an icon with no text, recommend using `aria-label` or assistive text. If the component has color-coded states, ensure there are text or icons as indicators for color-blind users.

Inkline components aim to be accessible by default, but it’s important to follow these guidelines. By adhering to WAI-ARIA practices, you ensure the UI is usable by all users.
