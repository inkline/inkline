# Nuxt Installation

Install Inkline for any Nuxt + Vue.js 3 application, as recommended by the community.

Nuxt offers lightning-fast development and optimized production builds, making it the perfect environment for Inkline. This integration gives you the best developer experience with instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and optimized performance.

## Installation

::DocsInstallStep{:number="1" title="Create a project"}

Start by creating a new Vue.js application through Nuxt's interactive CLI by running the command below in your terminal:

~~~bash
npx nuxi init my-nuxt-app

cd my-nuxt-app

npm install
~~~

This creates a new Vue project with Nuxt's blazing-fast build tooling already configured.

For more information about Nuxt, you can read the [Getting Started](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation){target="_blank"} guide.

::DocsInstallStep{:number="2" title="Install Inkline"}

Next, we'll use Inkline's CLI tool to automatically configure your project. Inkline will automatically detect your Nuxt.js development environment and generate a configuration file.

~~~bash
npx inkline@latest init
~~~

**What just happened?** The Inkline CLI:
1. Detected your Nuxt.js environment automatically
2. Added Inkline packages to your dependencies
3. Created an `inkline.config.ts` file with default theme settings
4. Updated your `nuxt.config.ts` to include Inkline's Nuxt module

If you prefer manual control over the integration, check out our [Manual Installation guide](/docs/getting-started/other).

Let's make sure everything is working correctly:

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Create a test component to verify that Inkline is working:

   ```html
   <ICard>ðŸŽ‰ Inkline is working!</ICard>
   ```
