# Card

Documentation and examples for the Card component, used for displaying content in a card layout with headers, footers, and structured content areas.

## Overview

A Card is a versatile container component that encapsulates content within a visually distinct panel layout. It is designed to segment related information into sections, making it easier for users to read content.

The `Card` component in Inkline can be used in various scenarios:
- *Standalone usage:* Wrap content in a card to highlight a specific block of information.
- *Grouped content:* Organize text, images, and actions into clearly defined sections.
- *Dashboard layout:* Display multiple cards as panels for summarizing data or statistics.
- *Interactive elements:* Combine with buttons or links to create clickable cards for navigation or actions.

## Import

```ts
import { Card } from 'inkline/card';
```

## Accessibility

By default, Inkline aims to ensure `Card` components are accessible out of the box. However, confirm your usage aligns with these best practices and any app-specific guidelines. Here are some accessibility considerations for the `Card` component:

**ARIA roles/attributes:**
- Consider using landmark roles such as `region` or `group` to define the card as a distinct section of the page.
- If the card contains important content or interactive elements, provide an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to clarify its purpose for screen readers.

**Keyboard navigation:**
- Although `Card` components are typically non-interactive, if you make a card clickable, ensure it is focusable (e.g., by adding `tabindex="0"`) and operable via keyboard (respond to **Enter** or **Space** keys).

**Additional guidelines:**
- Provide alternative text for any icons or images within the card to ensure that all conveyed information is accessible.
- Avoid relying solely on color to indicate information. You should combine color with text or icons for clarity.

## Best Practices

**Keep content concise:**
- Use `Card` components to encapsulate related information without overcrowding the design.

**Utilize header and footer for structure:**
- Leverage the `CardHeader` and `CardFooter` components to clearly separate the cardâ€™s content into logical sections.

**Consistent theming:**
- Adhere to the predefined color and size variants provided by Inkline to maintain visual consistency across your application.

**Interactive cues:**
- When using cards as clickable elements, clearly indicate their interactive nature with visual cues and proper ARIA attributes.

**Performance considerations:**
- While cards are lightweight components, ensure that any dynamic content within them is efficiently managed, especially in data-intensive dashboards.
