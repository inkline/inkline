# Clearfix Utilities

## Use the clearfix utility to clear floated content within a container. 

You can easily clear floats by adding the `._clearfix` helper class to the parent element.

In the following example, without adding the clearfix helper, the wrapping div would display the two buttons on separate lines, which would cause a broken layout.

<example type="clearfix" :component="examples.ClearfixBasicExample" :html="examples.ClearfixBasicExampleHTML"></example>

### Sass Mixin
The clearfix utility is also available as a Sass Mixin.

~~~scss
@require '~@inkline/inkline/src/css/mixins/clearfix'

.element {
  @include clearfix;
}
~~~
