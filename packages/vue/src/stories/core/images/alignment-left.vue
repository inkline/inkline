        Inkline is making this image float on the left side of the text. Inkline provides you with
        useful helper classes for positioning page elements such as images. The text will flow to
        the right and underneath this image, something you will find useful when adding left or
        right aligned images to a blog article. It is common to also add a right and bottom padding
        to the image.
