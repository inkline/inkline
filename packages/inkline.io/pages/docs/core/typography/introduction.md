Typography is one of the most important design elements of an application. { .lead }

Inkline provides you with basic elements, typography, and link styles. It uses a native font stack that selects the best 
font family for each OS and device. The base font size is `1rem`, so visitors can customize their font size as needed 
when zooming. 

When more control is needed, you should check out the textual utility classes. Each font size, style and 
weight also has a corresponding helper class to style other elements the same.
