# Layout
Build basic layouts using Inkline's built-in layout components. { .lead }

The layout components are used for scaffolding the basic structure of the page:
- `<i-layout>` is the main layout wrapper in which `i-layout-header`, `i-layout-aside`, `i-layout-content`, `i-layout-footer`, or `i-layout` itself can be nested, and can be placed in any parent container.
- `<i-layout-header>` is the header area that can also serve as navigation
- `<i-layout-aside>` is a container for side sections (usually a side nav).
- `<i-layout-content>` is the main content container
- `<i-layout-footer>` is a container for footer elements
